## Configuration

#### max_dimensions:

- max\_width x max\_height for which the pop-up is considered too big and should be resized, (default: `[320, 240]`).

#### search_mode: 

- `"project" (default):` searches for the hovered file name in the project.
- `"file":` joins the file path to the hovered file name and see if it makes a valid image path.

#### recursive:

- `true (default)`: takes only the name part of the hovered file name and performs a recursive search in the project (directories and subdirectories).
- `false`: sees if the hovered file name exists in the base folders of the project (directories only).

#### all_formats:

- all image formats to look for, (default: `["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "bmp", "gif", "ico", "svg", "svgz", "webp"]`).

#### formats\_to\_convert:

- images that require conversion before rendering, (default: `[".svg", ".svgz", ".webp"]`).

**Notes**

- if `"recursive": true` the path part is irrelevant, if you don't like this behavior you can set this to `false` and/or set `"search_mode"` to `"file"`.
- `"recursive"` is only relevant if `"search_mode"` is set to `"project"`.

## Requirements

- to preview images that need conversion the plugin requires [Imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php) and that `magick` command is in your path.
